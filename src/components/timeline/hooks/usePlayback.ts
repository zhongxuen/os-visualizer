/**
 * Playback, wired to React.
 *
 * Vendored from Internet Visualizer (see VENDORED.md); only the imports and the notes
 * that named Internet Visualizer files changed.
 *
 * This file is a *wrapper*, deliberately thin. Every rule about what play, seek, and
 * step actually do lives in `src/core/sim/playback.ts`, where it is framework-free and
 * unit-tested in a node environment. What is added here is the two things core cannot
 * have: somewhere to keep the state (a Zustand store) and something to move it (one
 * `requestAnimationFrame` loop).
 *
 * ## One loop, in one place
 *
 * `useRafLoop` below is the only `requestAnimationFrame` in the product. No component
 * owns a timer: the loop advances one number and everything on screen is recomputed
 * from it.
 *
 * The loop runs only while `status === 'playing'` and is cancelled the moment it is not,
 * so a paused module costs nothing. Frame deltas are clamped: coming back to a
 * backgrounded tab hands you one enormous delta, and without the clamp the run would
 * teleport to the end instead of resuming.
 *
 * ## Store per view, not per app
 *
 * A module page owns its store and passes it down (or shares it through
 * `PlaybackContext` for slot content). A global singleton would leak one module's
 * playhead into the next and make two simulations on one page impossible.
