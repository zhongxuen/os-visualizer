/**
 * The playback state machine -- virtual time, without React.
 *
 * Everything about "where are we in the run and is it moving" lives here, as plain
 * functions over a plain value. There is no clock in this file: nothing calls
 * `Date.now()`, nothing schedules a frame, nothing subscribes to anything. Something on
 * the outside -- one `requestAnimationFrame` loop in the visualization layer -- decides
 * that real time has passed and calls `tick`. That inversion is what makes playback
 * testable without a browser, and it is why the rules for "what does the left arrow key
 * do" are asserted in a node environment instead of by clicking.
 *
 * Every function is pure: state in, state out, no mutation. They return the *same*
 * object when nothing changed, so a store wrapping them can skip notifying subscribers.
 *
 * Specified in docs/implementation/03-simulation-core.md; wrapped by a Zustand store in
 * `src/components/viz/hooks/usePlayback.ts` (phase 04).
